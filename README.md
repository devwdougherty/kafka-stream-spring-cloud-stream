# Kafka Streams using Spring Cloud Stream (Microservices Example)

The Kafka Infrastructure (broker and other dependencies) are being built with a Docker image from Confluent.

**Domain-crawler:** Producer (Kafka)
**Domain-processor:** Processor (Kafka Stream)
**Domain-service:** Consumer (Kafka Stream)

**Topics:** web-domains, active.web-domain and inactive.web-domains.

## Technologies

- Java 11
- Spring Cloud
- Spring Web Client (reactive)
- Lombok
- Kafka Client
- Kafka Streams
- Docker Compose

## Knowledge

- With Kafka Vanilla: You need to build a KafkaTemplate.
- With Kafka Streams with Spring Cloud Stream: You donâ€™t need to build a KafkaTemplate.

## Differences between Kafka and Kafka Streams

Kafka's Streams library (https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) is built on top of the Kafka producer and consumer clients. Kafka Streams is significantly more powerful and also more expressive than the plain clients. It's much simpler and quicker to write a real-world application start to finish with Kafka Streams than with the plain consumer.

## To Test

- ( ) My broker is host on :9092, so, remove the :9091 port from DomainProcessor application.yml file.

## Next Steps

- ( ) Apply a not null value treatment on DomainCrawler when request data from API Domain Info.
- ( ) On DomainService build a storage service to save the data from Kafka-Topic producer.
- ( ) Send to `inactive.web-domains` topic the inactive domains from API Domain Info.
